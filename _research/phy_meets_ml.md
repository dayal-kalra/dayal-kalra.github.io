In the past few years, there has been some progress in understanding Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) through ideas from statistical physics. These studies have shed light on various theoretical questions about DNNs. This includes, their function space and generalization properties. For my master's thesis, I have worked on the information propagation in Deep ReLU networks with correlated weights. In particular, we show that ReLU networks with anti-correlated weights have an order-to-chaos criticality, unlike the uncorrelated weight case. Furthermore, we propose intializing ReLU networks at this criticality, and demonstrate that ReLU networks with anti-correlated intialization train faster.
